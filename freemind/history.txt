Changes made in FreeMind 0.8.FA Alpha 8
===============================
* Undo for all attribute operations

* There are only four possible situations: 
   (a) all the attributes are shown everywhere, 
   (b) no attributes are shown anywhere, and 
   (c) only some attributes are shown, accross the whole map
   (d) all attributes are temporarily shown for the currently selected node, a shortcut alt+f9 
* the "show all", "hide all" ans "show selected" attribute actions are a submenu of the view menu 
* the rest attribute actions (dialogs) have been put to tools 

* the button On/Off only switch the filtering, rather than editing
* When the label "No Filtering" is shown in the combo box, the On/Off button is be inactive

Filter Composer Dialog:
* Apply applies the filter selected in the list of filters, regardless of the filter selected in the combobox in the toolbar 
* OK closes the dialog and sets the currently selected filter in the list of filters as the current filter in the combobox

* other changes and refactorings

    + single click: fold
