FreeMind is a premier free mind-mapping software written in Java. The recent
development has hopefully turned it into high productivity tool. We are
proud that the operation and navigation of FreeMind is faster than that of
Mind Manager because of one-click "fold / unfold" and "follow link"
operations.
<p>
So you want to <b>write</b> a completely new <b>metaphysics</b>? Why don't
you use FreeMind? You have a tool at hand that remarkably resembles the tray
slips of Robert Pirsig, described in his sequel to Zen and the Art of
Motorcycle Maintenance called Lila. Do you want to <b>refactor</b> your
<b>essays</b> in a similar way you would refactor software? Or do you want
to keep personal <b>knowledge base</b>, which is easy to manage? Why don't
you try FreeMind? Do you want to <b>priorize</b>, <b>know</b> where you are,
where you've been and <b>where you are heading</b>, as Stephen Covey would
advise you? Have you tried FreeMind to keep track of all the things that are
needed for that?
<p>

<b>Did FreeMind make you angry?</b> Please <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=320014">write us</a>,
anonymously if you want.

<a name="h3_0"><h3>Download</h3></a> 

There are the following pre-compiled binaries:

<ul><li><a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/freemind/FreeMind-Windows-Installer-0_7_1.exe?download"><b>Windows Installer</b></a></li>
<li><a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/freemind/Mac_OS_X_FreeMind_0.7.1.zip?download"> <b>MAC OS X</b></a></li>
<li><a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/freemind/freemind_0.7.1-1_all.deb?download"> <b>Debian Linux</b></a></li>
<li><a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/freemind/freemind-0.7.1-2.noarch.rpm?download"> <b>SuSE (9.0) Linux</b></a></li>
</ul>
Or you download the independent <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/freemind/freemind-bin-0_7_1.zip?download">
<b>binaries</b></a> which fit into one
floppy disk. You can also download older versions, see <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7118">all files
for download</a>. However, please note that FreeMind <b>requires Java
1.4</b> or higher; <a 
href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html">download JRE - Java
Runtime Environment</a> for your platform or <a
href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/apple/java.html">download JRE
for Mac OS X</a>, if you do not have Java 1.4 already.

<a name="h3_1"><h3>Install and run</h3></a> 

Feel free to try our new installer called <b>FreeMind-Windows-Installer-0_7_1.exe</b>.
Or, download the latest binary, e.g. <b>freemind-bin-0_7_1.zip</b>, and unzip the
binary to some folder. If you are running Windows platform, double click
<b>freemind.exe</b> and you're running FreeMind. If you are on some of the
Unix / Linux platforms, open <b>freemind.sh</b>. You <b>don't need to
download sources</b> to run FreeMind. If you have problems with running
FreeMind on <b>Mac</b>, also try to simply <b>double-click freemind.jar</b>
located in the folder <b>lib/</b>.

<a name="h3_2"><h3>Get a taste of FreeMind</h3></a>
You can view maps created with FreeMind <b>now</b>, the only thing you need 
is Java 1.4 installed; just click one of the following links:

<ul>
<li><a href="PublicMaps.html">Daniel's public map</a> (some bookmarks and remarks)
<li><a href="Freemind-development.html">FreeMind development</a>
</ul>

If you wonder how the maps exported by FreeMind into HTML look like,
follow:

<a name="h3_4"><h3>What FreeMind is good for</h3></a>

<p>
Current users of FreeMind use it for the following purposes:
<ul>

<li><b>Keeping track of projects</b>, including subtasks, state of subtasks and time recording
<li>Project <b>workplace</b>, including links to necessary files, executables,
              source of information and of course information
<li>Workplace for <b>internet research</b> using Google and other sources
<li>Keeping a collection of small or middle sized <b>notes</b> with links 
    on some area which expands as needed. Such a collection of notes is
    sometimes called <b>knowledge base</b>.

<li><b>Essay writing</b> and <b>brainstorming</b>, using colors to show which essays are 
    open, completed, not yet started etc, using size of nodes to indicate
    size of essays. I don't have one map for one essay, I have one map for
    all essays. I move parts of some essays to other when it seems appropriate.
<li>Keeping a <b>small database</b> of something with <b>structure</b>,
    which is either <b>very dynamic</b> or <b>not known in advance</b>.  The
    main disadvantage of such approach when compared to traditional database
    applications are poor query possibilities, but I use it that way anyway
    - contacts, recipes, medical records etc. You learn about the structure
    from the additional data items you enter. For example, different medical
    records use different structure and you do not have to analyze all the
    possible structures before you enter the first medical record.
<li>Commented <b>internet favorites</b> or <b>bookmarks</b>, with colors and
    fonts having the meaning you want.
</ul>

<a name="h3_5"><h3>Features</h3></a>
<p>
Apart from other things, this release of FreeMind features:
<ul>

<li>Fully functional <b>following of HTML links</b> stored in the nodes, be
it www links or links to local files.

<li>From very early versions, Freemind supports <b>folding</b> which is its
essential property.

<li><b>Fast one-click navigation</b>, including folding / unfolding on one
click and following links on one click at the same time (you don't have to
make choice between fast following of links and fast fold/unfold). You can
move the map by dragging the map's background as well as using mouse wheel.

<li><b>Smart Drag'n Drop</b>, including the possibility to copy nodes or
copy style of nodes; dragging and dropping of multiple selected nodes;
dropping of texts or list of files from outside

<li><b>Smart copying and pasting into</b>, including pasting of links from HTML or
structuring the pasted content on the basis of the number of leading spaces
in a line; pasting of lists of selected files

<li><b>Smart copying and pasting from</b>, including plain text and RTF (MS
Wordpad, MS Word, MS Outlook messages).

<li><b>Export of map to HTML</b>, with folding (see <a href="PublicMaps-exported.html">example</a>)

<li><b>Find</b> facility, where found items are shown one by one as you do
"find next", and the map is unfolded only for the current item.

<li>Possibility to use and <b>edit long multiline nodes</b>; even with
<b>newlines</b>

<li>Possibility to decorate nodes with <b>built-in icons</b>, colors and different
fonts.

<li><b>Low costs of risk of switching away</b> to another mind mapping tool,
because FreeMind stores maps in <b>XML</b> format. If you have a lot of maps
created by FreeMind and you want to switch to another program, writing a
conversion program should be easy, especially if that program features
Visual Basic scripting facility. Christoph Rissner describes in his <a
href="http://courses.iicm.edu/~hkrott/site//docs/seminar/sem2002_mindmaps.pdf">article</a>
at <a
href="http://courses.iicm.edu/~hkrott/site/veranstaltungen/seminar/abgeschlossen.html">IICM
site</a> his implementation of data exchange between FreeMind and
MindManager.



<li>File mode enables you to <b>browse the files on your computer</b>,
<b>seeing</b> the folder structure <b>as mind map</b>.

<li>See more details in <a href="Freemind-development.html">Freemind development tree</a>

</ul>
Weak spots include:

<ul>

<li>The support of <b>pictures</b> in nodes is in preliminary stage. User
has to take care that he sends the images together with his mind maps /
trees.

<li>FreeMind is basically <b>one user</b> application. Even though users can
in principle work on the same map, there is only <b>preliminary locking
mechanism</b> to prevent conflicts, at the time, switched off by default.

<li>In <b>rare cases</b>, <b>following of HTML</b> links in the web browser
<b>does not work</b> on some computers; the same holds for opening local
files.

<li>The positioning of main branches is not under the control of users.
<li><b>Limited</b> support for <b>fancy graphics</b>.

</ul>

<a name="h3_6"><h3>License</h3></a>

FreeMind is a free software, licenced under GPL - <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU Public
License</a>. Basically, that means that you are free to use FreeMind to
whatever you want without paying for that, and that any code derived from
current FreeMind's code must also be licenced under GPL.

Help</a> forum.

<a name="h3_8"><h3>Is FreeMind mind mapping software?</h3></a>

The term <b>mind mapping</b> is related to british psychologist Tony
Buzan. In Buzan's context, mind map is a tree with many colors, pictures and
personal expression. <b>FreeMind is not</b> really <b>mind mapping</b>
software <b>in the sense of Tony Buzan</b>, nevertheless, one would say that
FreeMind belongs to the class of so called <b>mind mapping software</b>.<p>

Some of members of that class come pretty close to Buzan. Have a look at
the site of first class commercial mind mapping software <a
href="http://www.mindjet.com/">MindManager</a>. You may also want to see <a
href="http://www.mind-mapping.co.uk/mind-maps-examples.htm">examples</a> of
mind maps in Buzan's sense.

<a name="h3_9"><h3>Alternatives to using FreeMind</h3></a>

To achieve that which FreeMind offers, you can use variety of tools.

<ul>
  <li><b>Commercial mind mapping program</b>, for instance <a
  href="http://www.mindjet.com/">Mind Manager</a>, <a
  href="http://www.inspiration.com/">Inspiration</a>, <a
  href="http://www.visual-mind.com/">Visual Mind</a> or <a
  href="http://www.mindmapperusa.com/">MindMapper</a>.

  <li><b>Note editor</b> / <b>reference manager</b> / <b>PIM - personal
  information manager</b>, for instance open source <a
  href="http://www.tranglos.com/free/keynote.html">Key Note</a> for
  Windows. In the case of Key Note, you obtain folding, much richer text
  formatting than in FreeMind, many small notes in one file and it is quite
  easy to reorganize the structure of your notes. It is not so fast when it
  comes to changing the color of nodes and not so intuitive when you move
  things around. It is not possible to set a link to a node, only inside the
  note, which is sort of equivallent of FreeMind's node without
  children. Key Note is much faster because it is not written in Java, but
  it runs on Windows platform only.  Definitely worth having a look at.

  <li>Text editor with <b>Outline mode</b>, e.g. <a
  href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/">MS Word</a>, <a
  href="http://www.lyx.org/">LyX</a> or <a
  href="http://www.xemacs.org/">Emacs</a>. Outline mode enables you to fold
  headings and move complete "nodes" (chapters, sections, subsection)
  around, as well as changing the levels of the nodes. The convenience and
  speed of operation in the areas of restructuring, organizing, overviewing
  and adding items does not reach that of FreeMind, but on the other hand:
  if you already use one of these editors, you can avoid the extravagance of
  installing and learning to use a new tool and gain part of what FreeMind
  offers that way.

  <li>Text editor with <b>Folding mode</b>, e.g. <a
  href="http://www.xemacs.org/">Emacs</a>, <a
  href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> or <a
  href="http://www.jedit.org">jEdit</a>. Again, you achieve information
  hiding, but the overheads of using folding mode when compared to FreeMind
  are considerable.
              
</ul>

And if you want to give me a big gift, send me some of your mind maps so
that I can learn something from you - I will make sure it is not disclosed
to anyone else. I have certain doubts if something like that is acceptable
at all, because most of my mind maps are very personal. I make an offer that
I will send you some of my not so personal mind maps in exchange.

<a name="h3_12"><h3>What users say about FreeMind</h3></a>

<span class=username>Rich, 14.4.2004:</span>
First off, congratulations on a truly awesome application with a fantastically
intuitive interface... I thought I'd spend 10 minutes evaluating it but I had
so much fun I ended up playing for hours - I even missed lunch!
<p>
<span class=username>Daniel, 1.2.2003:</span>
How do I know that FreeMind is a high productivity tool? The answer is I
don't. I am using FreeMind on daily basis and am very satisfied with the
benefits it brings me. What I really consider important is that when I use
FreeMind, most of the time I don't have to ask myself "how do I do this
thing in FreeMind", but I rather just do what I need without thinking about
it. FreeMind makes my task of collecting, organizing and analyzing
information on a given topic much easier.
<p>
<span class=username>James, 14.10.2002:</span>
Now, having tried out the new release, I can tell you: It's brilliant! Well
done!
<p>
<span class=username>Henning, 21.11.2002:</span>
I recently started using FreeMind and I'm rather delightet.  After getting
to known it, it immediately became one of my every-day-use-tools.
<p>
<span class=username>Joe, 20.1.2003:</span>
I downloaded Freemind several months ago and it has become a vital part of
my daily activites. I am enormously grateful for the program.
<p>
<span class=username>Paul, 9.2.2003:</span>
What a splendid piece of work!
<p>
<span class=username>Tom, 13.2.2003:</span>
I appreciate version 6.1 very much. Having the DnD capability into and out
of my emails has now made Freemind the source document for my management
work. 6.1 is stable, simple and elegant in text, lines, and manipulation. I
prefer such elegance to commercial versions because I have work to do, not
time to make things look better. This is a superb complexity organizer.
<p>
I also use it at home to capture my martial arts learning as I head towards
a black belt. I put in the basic movements and the katas or arranged groups
of movements. I use that when I practice at home.
<p>
<span class=username>Perry, 10.4.2003:</span>
I have been using FreeMind for two or three months now, and find it totally
indispensable! I simply can't say enough good things about how it has helped
me get on top of an overwhelming workload. I've tried task managers and
project managers ad-nauseam, and they are either too simplistic or too
cumbersome.
